# Udacity Full-Stack Nanodegree Classroom

This repo includes the live coding portion of my lectures for Udacity Full-Stack Nanodegree students.

We are building a backend application called Udacity Hub which functions as a hub for udacity students and sessions leads.

The app is built using Node, Express and Typescript. 

This repo will be continuously updated and iterated upon.

Each session will include a project and a list of additional learning resources.
